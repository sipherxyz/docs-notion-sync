### Meet the Dokodemo Protocol: Your NFT's Magical Door to Fun on Funki Chain

The Dokodemo Protocol is a game-changer in the Funki Chain universe, flipping the script on how we play with digital assets, namely Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Think of it as the magic door from "Doraemon," but for your NFTs, letting them zip around to different digital playgrounds while still connecting back their original authentic self, no multiverse collapse imminent!

### What's the Dokodemo Protocol All About?

Basically, the Dokodemo Protocol lets your NFTs have a blast across various fun-filled digital environments without losing their cool, value (or key!). It's like having the superpower to be in multiple places at once, making sure your digital treasures can party everywhere but still safe at home.

### Cool Features of the Dokodemo Protocol

1. **Multiverse Mingle**: NFTs can show up in different forms across various games and platforms within Funki Chain. They’re always connected back to the original, so no matter where they go, they remember where they came from.
2. **Play Nice With Others**: This protocol is all about making friends! It helps your NFTs play smoothly with others by ensuring they can hop between different blockchain playgrounds without a hitch.
3. **Keepin' It Real (and Paid!)**: Go on and spread your NFTs far and wide—Dokodemo keeps tabs on the rights and royalties, making sure creators get their fair share, no matter where their creations end up.
4. **Who Did What Now?**: Thanks to blockchain magic, tracking the history and adventures of your NFTs is a breeze. It’s all about keeping things clear and legit, so everyone knows who owns what and what’s been going down.
5. **More Fun for Everyone**: By letting users see their NFTs in new lights and new fights, engagement goes through the roof. It’s a whole new way to bond with your digital buddies.

### Why It's a Big Deal

Dokodemo shakes things up by making NFTs more than just digital veblen dust collectors. They become dynamic adventurers that gain value and stories as they explore new realms. This not only makes each NFT more interesting and valuable but also cranks up the fun factor by a ton.

Imagine your favorite digital character not just stuck in one game but leveling up in multiple arenas, carrying its victories, loot, and tales from one world to another. It’s like giving your digital pal a life that’s richer than ever, stuffed with interactions that make every NFT uniquely yours.

### But you’re in it for “teh tech”?

At ***Dokodemo*** Protocol’s heart, Funki Chain utilizes the "Fun Feed" from various integrated entertainment blockchains, employing Innovative Protocol Compilers (IPCs) to create and evolve unique and engaging Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) with dynamic states. These states trigger diverse actions in a similar manner to game logic, enabling unprecedented composability and expandability through rich, interactive entertainment experiences.

### The Fun Feed

The Fun Feed is a core element of Funki Chain, acting as a channel for **real-time onchain data from various blockchain networks.** This data spans item generation, item states, user achievements, game assets, virtual world social interactions, and more, all unified under Funki Chain in a 'farcaster-like' manner.

By aggregating and maintaining this data, Funki Chain enables the development of rich applications that are both expansive and cross-chain interoperable in the future.

### The Fun Finders

Data Oracles are called Fun Finders and act as tools that fetch, verify, and relay data from external blockchains to Funki Chain's ecosystem. This data, crucial for the creation and evolution of NFTs and the activation of Fun Masters, includes user achievements, in-game transactions, and other relevant entertainment metrics. Ensuring the accuracy and timeliness of this data is paramount for the integrity of Funki Chain's ecosystem and the value of its NFT assets.

### The States of Fun

Inspired by "The Diamond Age," Protocol Compilers in Funki Chain are smart contracts capable of transforming the data extracted from Fun Oracles, through the Fun Feed into tangible source of truth NFT data states.

These digital PCs receive, synthesize, and compile information, assets, and user on-chain interactions within Funki Chain, to craft, expand, and program NFTs, triggering smart contracts that are rich in information and deeply connected to the entertainment worlds they originate from.

### Fun Masters

The Fun Masters represent Funki Chain's innovative approach to decentralized contribution & governance. As a distributed network of enthusiastic users, the Fun Masters contribute their time, creativity, and entertainment insights to enrich and verify the authenticity of the digital assets within Funki Chain.

Through this collaborative effort, the states of NFTs can be updated, enhanced, challenged, and made more complex, driven by a system of incentivized rewards, ensuring a vibrant and evolving digital asset ecosystem, akin to a decentralized, interactive funhouse.
