## Security Model

Funki is an OP Stack L2 and a key part of Optimism Superchain. Funki runs the OP Stack mainnet configuration in partnership with Optimism.

In return for ongoing technical and product support from Optimism, Funki contributes sequencer fees, and research and innovation to the OP Collective.

---

## Mainnet Multisig

The security of Funki L2 is currently dependent on a multisig managed jointly by the Funki Security Council, the [Optimism Security Council](https://gov.optimism.io/t/intro-to-optimisms-security-council/6885) and the Optimism Foundation.

This multisig can be used to upgrade core Funki L2 smart contracts **without upgrade delays** to allow for quick responses to potential security concerns. All upgrades to the system must be approved by both component multisigs and either can veto an upgrade.

## Bugs and Unknowns

The OP Stack has been audited [on many occasions](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/v1.1.4/technical-documents/security-reviews), but **audits are not a stamp of approval** and **a completed audit does not mean that the audited codebase is free of bugs.**

It's important to understand that using Funki inherently exposes you to the risk of bugs within the  codebase, and that you use Funki Mainnet at your own risk.
